# Student Performance Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This dashboard is designed for school administrators, teachers, guidance counsellors, program managers, and education researchers who need a clear, visual way to identify performance drivers and target interventions. It solves the problem of fragmented data by consolidating student-level scores and demographic context into a single, actionable view—making it easy to quantify the impact of test preparation, spot at risk students, compare subgroup performance, and prioritize resources for measurable improvement.

## Key Features
- Performance Metrics: Average scores (in %) for Math, Reading, Writing; student count; overall average score %.
- Demographic Insights: Performance breakdown by Gender and Ethnicity (Groups A–E).
- Parental Education Analysis: Correlation between parental education level and student outcomes.
- Test Preparation Impact: Comparison of students who completed test prep vs. those who did not.
- Top Performers: Identification of the top 5 students by average score in Maths, Reading, and Writing.
  
## Tech Stack
- Data: student_performance_100.xlsx (CSV/Excel)
- Visualization: Power BI
- Calculations: DAX measures for aggregated metrics
  
## Key Insights
- Test preparation strongly improves scores.
- Gender shows a negligible difference in the average score % (Female ≈ 61.26%, Male ≈ 61.08%).
- Ethnicity differences in the average score % are small; no extreme disparities across groups.
- Parental education — Contrary to expectations, higher parental education is linked to slightly lower student averages, suggesting that direct academic factors like test preparation, study habits, and curriculum difficulty have a stronger impact on performance.
- Top performers are tightly clustered indicating a highly competitive group.
  
## Actionable Recommendations
1.	Expand access to test preparation programs and track pre/post-performance.
2.	Maintain gender neutral interventions; focus resources on universal supports.
3.	Emphasize study habits and school based interventions rather than assuming parental background is determinative.
4.	Offer enrichment for high performers and monitor equity across groups.
